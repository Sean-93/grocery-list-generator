        <p>
            You can input meals (comprised of ingredients), and you can also add individual ingredients.  
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            You can then generate a grocery list from whatever meals you add & select + whatever extra ingredients you need as well.

            Need to add something else that isn't food?  You can add that to your list, too!
